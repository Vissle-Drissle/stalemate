# Stalemate
Stalemate is a script for Chatango that logs in to your accounts to prevent them from expiration, it logs in to multiple at once and shows time taken as well as what accounts it was not able to log in to if any.

## Usage

- Install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- While installing Python, make sure "pip" is ticked in the `Optional Features`
- Open command prompt and type `pip install requests`, if command is not recognized try restarting your computer
- Download the ZIP folder
- Unzip the folder when finished downloading
- Edit `accounts.txt` with the account details you want to log using the example format

- Remove login data from `accounts.txt` when done
